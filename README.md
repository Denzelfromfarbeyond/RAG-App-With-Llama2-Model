RAG LLM (Retrieval Augmented Generation Language Model) App

Overview
This repository contains a simple RAG LLM (Retrieval Augmented Generation Language Model) app built using Python. The app utilizes PyPDF to extract text from PDF documents, LLAMA2 for retrieving relevant passages, and Hugging Face's transformers library to generate text.

Requirements
To run this app, you need the following dependencies:



Python 3.x
PyPDF2
LLAMA2
Hugging Face

You can install the dependencies using pip:


Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-App-With_Llama2-Model.git


Navigate to the cloned repository:
bash
cd RAG-App-With_Llama2-Model
Run the app:

Copy code

python app.py

Follow the instructions prompted by the app to provide a PDF file and a query.

Functionality
PDF Parsing: The app utilizes PyPDF2 to extract text from PDF documents.
Relevant Passage Retrieval: It queries LLAMA2 with the provided query to retrieve relevant passages from a pre-indexed document collection.
Text Generation: Using Hugging Face's transformers library, the app generates text based on the retrieved passages and the provided query.

Configuration
You can configure the app by modifying the following parameters in the config.py file:

LLAMA2_ENDPOINT: The endpoint URL for the LLAMA2 service.
MAX_PASSAGES: The maximum number of passages to retrieve from LLAMA2.
MAX_GENERATION_LENGTH: The maximum length of the generated text.
